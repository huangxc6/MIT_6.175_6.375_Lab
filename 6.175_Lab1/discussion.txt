1. How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
    one-bit multiplexer use 4 gates : 1 or, 2 and, 1 not.
    5-bit   multiplexer use 4 * 5 = 20 gates
    N-bit   multiplexer use 4 * N gates

2. Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
    8-bit ripple-carry adder require 5 * 8 = 40 gates
    8-bit carry-select adder require 5 * 4 (lower_result) + 5 * 4 * 2 (upper_result) + 4 * 5 (5-bit multiplexer) = 80 gates

3. Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
    the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take 8 * A
    the 8-bit carry-select adder take 4 * A + M
